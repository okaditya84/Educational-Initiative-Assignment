# Smart Home Simulation

## Overview

The Smart Home Simulation project is a Java application that simulates a smart home system. It allows users to control different smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks through a central hub. Users can turn devices on/off, schedule tasks, and automate actions based on specific triggers.

## Features

1. **Device Management**
   - Initialize the smart home system with various devices, each having a unique ID and type (light, thermostat, door lock).
   - Add or remove devices dynamically.

2. **Control Devices**
   - Turn devices on/off via commands.
   - Schedule devices to perform actions at specific times.

3. **Automation**
   - Set automated tasks based on triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature).

4. **Status Reporting**
   - Get real-time status reports for all devices, including their current state.

5. **Scheduled Tasks and Triggers**
   - View scheduled tasks and automated triggers in the system.
