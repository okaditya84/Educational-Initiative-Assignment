# Educational Initiative Assignment

This repository contains the assignment for the Educational Initiative Placement Drive. The assignment is divided into two main exercises, focusing on design patterns and smart home automation.

## Exercise 1: Design Patterns with Marvel Theme

In this exercise, we explore various design patterns using Marvel-themed examples. The patterns are categorized into three main types:

### 1. Behavioural Design Patterns
- **Observer Pattern** (`ObserverPatternMarvel.java`)
- **Strategy Pattern** (`StrategyPatternMarvel.java`)

### 2. Creational Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern** (`FactoryPatternMarvel.java`)
- **Singleton Pattern** (`SingletonPatternMarvel.java`)

### 3. Structural Design Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern** (`AdapterPatternMarvel.java`)
- **Composite Pattern** (`CompositePatternMarvel.java`)

## Exercise 2: Smart Home Automation

This exercise demonstrates the application of design patterns in a real-world scenario: smart home automation. The system is structured as follows:

- **Devices** (`devices` package):
  - `DoorLock.java`
  - `Light.java`
  - `SmartDevice.java` (likely an interface or abstract class)
  - `Thermostat.java`

- **Factory** (`factory` package):
  - `SmartDeviceFactory.java`: Implements the Factory pattern for creating smart devices.

- **Hub** (`hub` package):
  - `SmartHomeHub.java`: Central control unit for the smart home system.

- **Main** (`main` package):
  - `SmartHomeSimulation.java`: Entry point for running the smart home simulation.

- **Proxy** (`proxy` package):
  - `SmartDeviceProxy.java`: Implements the Proxy pattern for smart devices.

This structure showcases the use of multiple design patterns in a practical application, including Factory, Proxy, and potentially others like Observer or Command patterns.
